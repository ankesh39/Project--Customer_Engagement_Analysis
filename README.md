# Project--Customer_Engagement_Analysis
This project aims to analyze the customer engagement data of the 365 Financial Analyst platform, a learning platform that introduced new features in 2022 with the goal of increasing student engagement. The primary objective is to determine whether the new additions, such as an XP system, in-app coins, leaderboards, and an expanded course library, have effectively boosted student engagement.

The analysis involves working with a dataset containing information about students who used the 365 Data Science platform in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022. The dataset includes details like student IDs, countries, subscription plans (paid or free), and the number of minutes watched during each quarter.

Key steps in the analysis include:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating and interpreting measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis to understand engagement patterns among paid and free-plan students.
**2.** **Confidence Intervals**: Constructing confidence intervals to estimate the true average minutes watched by paid and free-plan students, and comparing their engagement levels.
**3.** **Hypothesis Testing**: Performing hypothesis tests to determine if the engagement levels (measured by minutes watched) of paid and free-plan students increased from Q4 2021 to Q4 2022, and exploring potential differences between US and Indian students.

The project leverages Excel for data analysis and employs statistical techniques like t-tests and F-tests to draw conclusions and provide recommendations based on the findings.

Through this analysis, the project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of the new platform features in driving customer engagement, identify areas for improvement, and suggest strategies to enhance the overall user experience and retention.
